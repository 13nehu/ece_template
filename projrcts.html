  	<h1> Projects </h1>
  	<p>
  	Projects are a result of the culmination of ideas and efforts. At IIIT Allahabad, it is our ultimate goal to inclucate into our students the capability to follow their own dreams, and fabricate them in the realm of possiblity. The primary objective of our mentors is to give the student only the necessary pieces of the puzzle, and the motivation to not give up against all odds...

Projects Registered in this Semester will be shown here :

  		<h4>Impurities detection in Liquids using RF sensor</h4>
  		<img src="images/1.jpg" >
  		<p>Description :Our aim is to design a device which can detect resonance frequency of any pure as well as impure liquid without using Vector Network Analyzer so that it could be a cost effective device. we are using a RF source to generate input to the device and the same RF source to be given to the mixer. Output frequency of the device and tuner frequency will be fed to a device which will provide output only when both the frequencies will be same. we have precaliberated table of frequency change vs impurity level, after a little processing of data (frequency change and table) in microcontroller we will get to know the level of impurities.
